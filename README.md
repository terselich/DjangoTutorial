To run the server is very simple, the repository comes with a virtual enviroment, you dont need to have install Python on your computer to run it, all libraries necessary to run the server are included in the /venv/bin folder.

To **run** use the following command in your terminal(Unix or Linux) remember to be in the filder DjangoTutorial/: 

```python
    DjangoTutorial$ python3 manage.py runserver
```

The default port is **:8000/** how ever you can change it to any port as follows:

```python
exec ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:<your_port>
```
